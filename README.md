PocketLedger — Personal Expense Tracking SaaS Demo

PocketLedger is a lightweight, polished Laravel 12 demo application built to showcase clean architecture, real-world SaaS patterns, and modern development practices.
It includes a complete CRUD for personal expenses, user authentication, authorization via policies, a service layer, seeders with realistic financial data, and a Bootstrap-based UI designed for clarity and usability.

This project highlights:

Multi-user ownership control using Laravel Policies

Clean, maintainable architecture with dedicated Service classes

Secure authorization flow (show/edit/delete only your own records)

Paginated expense listing with edit/delete actions and confirmation modal

Seeders with realistic monthly expenses (Aug 2025 → Jan 2026)

Form Requests for validation and permissions

Bootstrap 5 UI, Montserrat typography, and toast notifications

Modern UX with AJAX delete confirmation & success/error toasts

PocketLedger serves as a compact but production-minded template for building scalable SaaS applications, demonstrating how structure, organization, and security seamlessly work together in a real-world Laravel project.
